nothingness is all-encompassing

What if I spoof `RST`? (to try to disconnect someone)
e.g. to block particular IP... (and bam - social engineering)

Could I throttle everyones TCP on LAN spoofing multiple `duplicate ACK`s to them?

I can't find scans in main machine `wireshark` from `VM`s. Only DNS query shows O.o

`foobar`

`splunk` - `boss of the soc`
