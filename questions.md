nothingness is all-encompassing

Why is `recv. window` field so small [16 bits] when `seq. nr. field` is [32 bits]?
I get `recv. window` <= 1/2 `seq. nr. field`, but thats a huge difference

What if I spoof `RST`? (to try to disconnect someone)
e.g. to block particular IP... (and bam - social engineering)

Could I throttle everyones TCP on LAN spoofing multiple `duplicate ACK`s to them?

I can't find scans in main machine `wireshark` from `VM`s. Only DNS query shows O.o
